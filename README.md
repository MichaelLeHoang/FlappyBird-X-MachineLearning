Flappy Bird AI with NEAT üê¶
Project Overview
This project implements a Flappy Bird game clone where an AI, trained using the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, learns to play the game. The AI controls the bird, navigating through pipes by flapping at optimal times to avoid collisions and maximize score.
Features

Game Mechanics: Classic Flappy Bird gameplay with a bird navigating through randomly generated pipes.
AI Training: Utilizes the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks that control the bird's actions.
Graphics: Uses Pygame for rendering the game, including bird animations, pipes, and a scrolling base.
Scoring: Tracks the number of pipes successfully passed by the bird.
Fitness Evaluation: The AI's fitness is based on survival time and pipes cleared, with penalties for collisions.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Pygame
NEAT-Python
Image assets (bird, pipe, base, background) located in the imgs directory

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Install Dependencies:
pip install pygame neat-python


Prepare Assets: Ensure the following image files are in the imgs directory:

bird1.png, bird2.png, bird3.png (bird animation frames)
pipe.png (pipe image)
base.png (ground image)
bg.png (background image)


Configure NEAT: Ensure the config_feedforward.txt file is in the project directory. This file defines the NEAT algorithm's parameters, such as population size and mutation rates.


Usage

Run the Game:
python flappy_bird_ai.py

The script will load the NEAT configuration, initialize the population, and start training the AI. The game window will display multiple birds (each controlled by a neural network) attempting to navigate the pipes.

Training Process:

The NEAT algorithm runs for up to 50 generations (configurable in the script).
Each generation, birds are evaluated based on their fitness (survival time and pipes passed).
The best-performing neural network is retained, and the population evolves through mutation and crossover.


Controls:

No manual controls are available, as the AI fully controls the birds.
Close the Pygame window to stop the simulation.

How It Works

Bird Class: Manages the bird's position, velocity, tilt, and animation. The AI decides when to flap based on neural network outputs.
Pipe Class: Generates and moves pipes with random heights, handling collision detection.
Base Class: Handles the scrolling ground for visual continuity.
NEAT Integration: Each bird is controlled by a feedforward neural network. Inputs include the bird's y-position, distance to the pipe's top, and distance to the pipe's bottom. The output determines whether to flap.
Fitness Function: Birds gain fitness for surviving longer and passing pipes, with penalties for collisions.

Notes

The image paths in the code (e.g., E:\Python\ML\Game\FlappyBird\imgs\) are hardcoded. Update them to match your local directory structure.
The AI's performance improves over generations, but training may require tuning the NEAT configuration (e.g., population size, mutation rates).
The game runs at 30 FPS, and the simulation may slow down with a large population size.

Future Improvements

Save and load trained models to resume training or deploy the best AI.
Add a manual play mode for human players.
Implement a graphical interface to visualize training progress and neural network performance.
Optimize collision detection and rendering for smoother performance.
